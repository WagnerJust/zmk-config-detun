## Source of Truth
- **Always** consult keyboard_visualizer/keyboard_visualizer.spec in this directory for:
  - Technology stack and architecture decisions
  - Project requirements and constraints
  - Implementation details and standards
- The spec file is the authoritative reference for all project decisions
- **ALWAYS** If you change anything in the app that is not in the spec file, update the spec file accordingly

## Code Style
- No emoji in code, comments, or console output
- Minimize comments - code should be self-documenting
- Only add comments when explaining complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names

## Documentation Sources
- **ALWAYS** Use context7 MCP server to access latest documentation for all libraries OR remote repositories. Some are listed below:
  -- /zmkfirmware/zmk
  -- Three.js
- Stay current with official docs rather than relying on outdated information

## Other
- No build step required - pure vanilla JS
- Works with Python/PHP/Node HTTP serverss

## PROHIBITED
- Do not use emojis in comments, logs, or anywhere unless expliclity asked.
- **NEVER** EDIT OR CREATE ANY MARKDOWN FILES UNLESS EXPLICITLY ASKED BY THE USER TO DO SO.
